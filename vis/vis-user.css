/* Adverts on the right are not displayed on all devices (e.g. mobile phone)
   Through reverse engineering/testing I see that the advert is placed into
   a div with ID "legendeW", that is hidden through the style attribute
   "display: none". This additional attribute seems to be served server-side
   (only on page reload).
   It seems that the trigger is the device min-device-pixel-ratio and not
   bound to the min-width/height. */
